# We-Love-Movies-Project

This project was made for users that needed suggestions for a new movie to watch. You could look up a movie by name and you could see where and when the movie would be shown near you. Also you can have the app suggest a movie to you based on genres.

## Motivation

This was created as part of my project for the Thinkful Software Engineering course. This was a good project to practice and learn about the backend, from managing migrations to building complex routes. I also had to build servers and access data through a database.
